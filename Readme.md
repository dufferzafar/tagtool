# tagtool

Tagtool is a quick and easy-to-use tool for mass editing and cleaning metadata across your MP3 collection. 

I wrote the initial version as a [simple script](https://github.com/dufferzafar/tagtool/blob/old/tagfix.py) that just worked. This tool later became an exercise in command line application design as I'd never done it before. It uses [docopt](http://docopt.org/) (along with some hackery to allow sub-commands)

## install

`pip install tagtool`

You could also use [`pipsi`](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi) to install.

## tagfix

Tagfix is a script that uses the available tagtool commands as building blocks and performs multiple cleaning operation on files in one pass. If you download music from sites like [songspk](http://songspk.cc/) and [djmaza](http://www.djmaza.info/), this script is for you. It removes all mentions of these websites from the tags.
